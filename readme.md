# Capstone

This project starts with a dataset of one month of Customer data from Starbucks app users.
There were three files:
+ Transcript - A list of offer interactions (receive/view/complete), and all other transactions during the test period.

+ Portfolio — Offers sent during the 30-day test period, via web, email, mobile or social media channels, or a combination thereof. The offers have varying levels of difficulty (minimum spend) and reward, and fall into one of three categories: Discount, Buy-one-get-one (BOGO), Informational

+ Customer profiles — their age, gender, income, and date of becoming a member.

# Goal 

Create an effective method for customer outreach for underperforming groups.  

# Action Plan

1.  Data Wrangling
2.  Data Exploration and Analysis - E.D.A.
3.  Principal Component Analysis
4.  K-Means Clustering
5.  Explore Differences in clusters
6.  Create an offer for each group to increase revenue
7.  Create model to predict weather an offer will be completed or viewed
8.  Predict how effective the proposed offers are
